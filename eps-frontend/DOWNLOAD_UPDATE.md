# Download Functionality Update

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Fixed
- **Before**: Clicking "Download" opened video files in browser (new tab/window)
- **After**: Clicking "Download" actually downloads files to user's device

## âœ… Solution Implemented

### 1. **New Download Method in FileService**
- Added `downloadFile()` method that:
  - Fetches file as blob
  - Creates temporary download URL
  - Forces browser download (not streaming)
  - Cleans up resources properly

### 2. **Updated UI Components**
- **FileExplorer**: Updated download buttons with loading states
- **Video Modal**: Download button now forces download instead of streaming
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons show "Downloading..." during process

### 3. **Enhanced Features**
- âœ… **Download State Tracking** - Shows "Downloading..." while processing
- âœ… **Error Handling** - Fallback to old method if download fails  
- âœ… **Proper Cleanup** - Blob URLs cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- âœ… **Console Logging** - Track download progress for debugging

## ðŸš€ How It Works Now

1. **User clicks "Download"** â†’ Button shows "Downloading..."
2. **Fetch as blob** â†’ File downloaded as binary data
3. **Create download link** â†’ Temporary anchor with `download` attribute
4. **Auto-click download** â†’ Browser's native download dialog
5. **Cleanup** â†’ Remove temporary elements and URLs

## ðŸŽ¯ Result
- âœ… Video files download to user's device
- âœ… No more unwanted browser navigation  
- âœ… Proper file names preserved
- âœ… Works with all file types
- âœ… Professional download experience

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
window.open(downloadUrl, "_blank");

// After (proper download)
await fileService.downloadFile(currentPath, fileName);
```
